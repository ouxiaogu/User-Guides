子曰：「君子道者三，我無能焉：仁者不憂，知者不惑，勇者不懼。」子贡曰：“夫子自道也。”

Confucius said："The way of the gentleman has three aspects which I am incapable of; 

 - with benevolence there is no worries, 
 - with wisdom there is no doubts, 
 - with courage there is no fears." 

Zi Gong said:"Is it not the Master is describing himself?"
