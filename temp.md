## Action:

1. Give PRD for MOD-6773, tsmc asks official LUA template to calculate MEEF, ILS, DOF, and BFshift in one job
2. r150101 test, MOD-6667 - ResistSelection stages organization/runtime optimization:  PTD allform type and NTD advanced type are accelerated a lot, other types are not so notable
3. Case-16545, TCC number of Brion Model: answered how to find TCC message in log, and set on GUI/Lua

5. Task-5531, LUA script to estimate CD uncertainty caused by process sensitivity: 
  - finish the study of autocal_opticalsensitivity code
  - complete the code for "aiBlur", "ai\_location", "defocus", "focusBlur", "inner\_sigma", "outer\_sigma", "maskBlur","InnerCorner", "OuterCorner", "MaskBias"
  - m3dlib for different SWA remain as a problem.

## next week plan:

1. Task-5531, LUA script to estimate CD uncertainty caused by process sensitivity, solve the issue of adding a different SWA m3dlib model 
2. PRD for iCal Review improvement tickets: PLT-30856, PLT-30857, PLT-30858, PLT-30859, and PLT-30875
