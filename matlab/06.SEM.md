## SEM

### filter

impulse noise, or the images with salt and pepper noise,

median filter is very effective.

### conversion

1. im2double, just convert RGB uint8 image into [0, 1] double image

Input I1, like this a*b*3 unit8, whose value vary from 0 to 255 
Output I2, it will vary from 0 to 1

```MATLAB
I2 = im2double(I1);
```
2. image size

```MATLAB
[height, width] = size(I); % size also return rowXcolumn, then height must come first.
I(x, y); %  x as col index , y as row index 
```
